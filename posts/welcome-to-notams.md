## What are FlyByWire Simulations NOTAMs?

Originally our NOTAMs were delivered using graphics to share our progress, feature images, and other relevant news regarding the A32NX on our social media. With the launch of our new website, we are glad to announce the return of  FlyByWire Simulations NOTAMs. 

Short for "Notice to Airmen", you may wonder what to expect from our NOTAMs. Every NOTAM will be released whenever there is news to share and will  contain  the latest information to keep you up-to-date on what is on our minds. We'll announce each new NOTAM through our social media channels and Discord so that you never miss out.

### Below you'll find a short list of content we plan on including:

* Important Announcements
* Regular development updates
    * Information on features rolled into Stable or Development
* Developer insights / videos (time permitting)
* Featured videos from FlyByWire or our partners
* General Information on the project

We aim keep the structure of each NOTAM similar to the last with handy "quick links" so that you can easily find the information you are looking or are interested in quickly.

## Content Information

At the start of each NOTAM we will provide a short list of any **Important Announcements**. This will include upcoming videos such as our In the Hangar series and information regarding the status of the A32NX.

Let's take a quick dive into the other sections so you get a better understanding of the content we are providing.

### Development Updates

As the A32NX project matures we have started to include more realistic features everyday such as the latest flight model and custom AP we hope everyone is enjoying so far. We regularly try to keep our community updated through our socials and Discord. However, those channels have limited space for us to really give you a larger picture of what we include in our branches and what exactly these updates change for you as a pilot. We aim to use our NOTAMs to provide a deeper insight into these new features periodically.

Ideally in this section you would see a short changelog of what we have recently include into our Stable and Development branches. You can expect to see more updates regarding the Development Branch on a regular basis, however when we do update the Stable Branch we'll also provide that information here. 

We will choose to expand upon certain more complex updates to either branch to showcase how the update affects your flight and general aircraft performance.

### Developer Insights / Videos

One thing we'd like to include are short snippets from our development team on projects they have started, are working on, or have finished. Think of it as a little behind the scenes peek at on going features. Not only will you be aware of things not yet available but also have a first hand explanation from the author of that feature! The only note we'd like to mention is that as a volunteer open source group we'll include these insights as time permits from the developer.

### Featured Videos

I'm sure most you have seen our Stable v0.6.0 Release Trailer. Featured videos such as those will be readily included in our NOTAMs so you never miss out! Additionally we plan on including videos from our partners regarding the use of the A32NX and relevant features. These videos we hope to help bring awareness to features in a video format or assist our community with issues such as throttle calibration.

### General Information

This section will mostly stay the same through the lifetime of FlyBywire NOTAMs. It will include links for our users to find us on our social media, information on where to get support, our known / reported issues, and links to download the A32NX.

We're excited to bring back NOTAMs and we hope you enjoy reading through them.

Safe skies and happy flying!
