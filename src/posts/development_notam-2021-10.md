## Overview

We hope you are enjoying our latest [Stable Release v0.7.0](https://docs.flybywiresim.com/release-notes/v070/). Work on our custom FMS proceeds apace and we hope to roll the feature into development as soon as we iron out all the leftover bugs. We have some exciting features planned ahead for everyone and would also like to share some insight into the inner workings of our development process. Read on below!

## Our Development Process

### Philosophy

For close to a year now our growing core team and over 170 contributors have given their free time to create complex systems integrations and realistic features entirely from scratch. Our core principle is to maintain professional standards and industry-wide best practices delivering high-quality, tested products. We don't believe in intermediary measures in relation to our custom systems and strive to provide a complete interpretation of a working feature. Unlike other aircraft or products you can take a deep dive into our code on GitHub and see for yourself - and maybe stick around, help us out, or even start your own project!

Once on our GitHub you can see our code base and more importantly our "pull requests" which are essentially features, fixes, or changes to the A32NX. Each pull request is created by a core member or an outside contributor interested in creating something for our addon. Before any pull request is ever available to the public we ensure it follows this general process:

- Has documentation and is available on the IRL A320neo.
- Code review.
- Any pilot or engineer feedback.
- Rounds of QA testing to identify issues.

### Quality Assurance Teams

While possibly unknown to a lot of our user base we actually have dedicated QA testers also working in their free time to test every feature before they are released to the public on our Stable or Development branches. We are immeasurably grateful to these folk for giving their time to following our testing instructions and providing feedback to our developers.

If you'd like to know more about our QA process we have a handy guide on our documentation site and just maybe you'd be interested in joining our QA ranks.
