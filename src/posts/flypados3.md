## Overview

We are happy to introduce our most feature rich update to our onboard electronic flight bag (EFB) - the flyPadOS 3. We have completely overhauled the user interface with our 
new branding scheme while bringing a new user experience to the table. One of our main highlights to user experience is being the first EFB in flight simulation to offer 
support for multiple languages across the entire EFB. This would not have been possible without the kind support from our community providing translations and reviews.

There are other goodies for our pilots to dive into as well including updated Navigraph support, a new and improved pushback feature with onboard map, lighting presets, and in 
flight checklists! To learn more about what's new and upcoming features keep reading below.
