## Overview

We're happy to introduce the most feature rich update yet to our onboard Electronic Flight Bag (EFB) - flyPadOS 3. The user interface has been completely overhauled with FlyByWire's new branding scheme, bringing a new user experience to the table. One of the main highlights is being the first EFB in flight simulation to offer support for multiple languages across the entire EFB. This would not have been possible without the kind support from our Community - providing translations and reviews.

There are other goodies for our pilots to dive into as well, including updated Navigraph support, a new and improved pushback feature with onboard map, lighting presets, and in-flight checklists! 

## New Features

### UX/UI

At FlyByWire, we believe in well designed and integrated user interfaces that bring a great quality of life experience to our users. Since the introduction of our flyPad to MSFS, we've done away with copying real world operating systems - instead building a cohesive UI that easily integrates useful features at the tip of your cursor. Starting up the EFB requires a simple click on the screen, where you're greeted with our unique dashboard. From here, you can seamlessly download your simBrief OFP to display all the information required for 
your planned flight. Everything that's important for your flight is on the new dashboard:

- Shortcuts to take you to where you want to go.
- Flight status and general information including your planned route.
- METAR information - customizable with your choice of ICAO (displayed raw or with simple symbology).
- Active and upcoming checklists.
- Pinned Navigraph charts.
- Active failure management.

This user experience extends throughout our flyPadOS, enabling our pilots to quickly peruse their OFP, access calculations / charts, and integrate easily with online networks such as VATSIM or IVAO.

As you navigate throughout the EFB accessing different features and interacting with them, flyPadOS 3 now remebers the state you left it in. It remembers the pages or tabs with the associated data you have entered, so you can safely switch to a new screen without losing any data.

// Probably include here the following: Failures (new UI?), Navigraph maps changes, etc.
- new fresh themed ui
- better state management - pages remember state (tabs) and data 
- more information about the flight status
- direct shortcuts to important flight pages from the Dashboard (pinnable charts, checklists, failures)
- Direct fuel loading from Simbrief

### Localisation

We are extremely happy to offer support for over 30+ languages onboard our EFB. A first in flight simulation, you can now access all the features mentioned above and interact with them in a language of your choice! This would not have been possible without the help of over 200 contributors, and those who have offered to review every corner of the EFB for accuracy. A huge benefit of an open source project is our unique position to have our community assist in endeavors such as this. We cannot stress enough how thankful we are.

### Pushback

- Smooth pushback with fine control of speed and direction.
- Using buttons or a controller axis to steer the tug - rudder axis for direction and elevator axis for speed.
  - Allows users with twisting joysticks to fully conduct the pushback with their stick.
- Pushback map - A local map to guide your pushback without the need to change to an external view.
  - Turn predication indicator to support precise turns

### Performance Calculation

- Improved UI for the top of decent and landing calculation

### Lighting Presets

We know that starting a flight in a cold and dark state means you have a lot to do before you can get off the ground and climb into the sky. As a small quality of life feature we have included a fully customizable interior lighting preset. You can set your virtual cockpit with the lighting setup you desire and instantly load that preset in "one click"! 

Need to step away for a moment but want to quickly transition your cockpit for night operations? Simply press the "Load Preset" and be on your way.

### Checklists

We've included essential interactive checklists, accssible through its own tab in the left menu. The dashboard on the EFB also intelligently recommends the correct checklist based on the current phase of flight you are in.

The checklists page will also display what checklist you currently have active, and what checklist you have yet to complete. You can use your mouse to click on each line item, or simply use the "mark item as complete" button at the bottom of the page. If you would like to utilize your hardware, we have some easy to use LVARs for those of you who can write to those.

- Interactive Checklists.
- Autocheck for various items.
- Easy to use - mapping to button available for users who can write to LVARs.
